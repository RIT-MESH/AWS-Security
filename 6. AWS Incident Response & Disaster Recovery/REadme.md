#### Incident Response Best Practices
**Theory Explanation:**
Incident response is the process of identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents, minimizing impact on operations. In **AWS**, this involves using services like **CloudWatch** for monitoring, **CloudTrail** for API call history, **GuardDuty** for threat detection, **Systems Manager** for incident management, and **Config** for configuration management. The process includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities, ensuring a structured approach to handling disruptions.

**UI Steps:**
- **Set up CloudWatch Alarms:** Navigate to the **CloudWatch** console, create alarms for specific metrics indicating potential issues.
- **Configure GuardDuty:** Enable **GuardDuty** to detect and report threats, set up notifications for findings.
- **Use Systems Manager Incident Manager:** Enable Incident Manager, create response plans for different incident types, and manage incidents by assigning responders and tracking progress.

**CLI Steps:**
- Create a **CloudWatch** Alarm: `aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "CPUAlarm" --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqual --evaluation-periods 1 --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace "AWS/EC2" --period 300 --statistic Average --threshold 70 --actions-enabled --alarm-actions "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:topic-name"`
- Enable **GuardDuty**: `aws guardduty create-detector --enable`
- Create a **Config** Rule: `aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://path/to/config-rule.json`

#### Disaster Recovery Strategies (Pilot Light, Warm Standby, Multi-Site)
**Theory Explanation:**
Disaster recovery strategies in **AWS** are designed to minimize downtime and data loss, with options like Backup and Restore (simplest, higher RTO/RPO), Pilot Light (minimal active resources, quicker recovery), Warm Standby (scaled-down full environment, ready to scale up), and Multi-Site Active/Active (multiple active sites, lowest RTO/RPO). Each strategy balances cost, complexity, and recovery objectives, supported by services like **AWS** Backup and Elastic Disaster Recovery (**AWS** DRS).

**UI Steps:**
- **Set up Backup and Restore:** Use **AWS** Backup to automate backups, define plans with schedules and retention policies, assign resources like EC2 instances and RDS databases.
- **Implement Pilot Light with **AWS** DRS:** Set up **AWS** DRS, install replication agents on source servers, configure recovery instances, and test recovery processes.
- **Configure Warm Standby:** Maintain a scaled-down version in another region, use Auto Scaling for capacity management.
- **Implement Multi-Site Active/Active:** Deploy applications in multiple regions, use Route 53 for traffic management with health checks.

**CLI Steps:**
- Create an **AWS** Backup Plan: `aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan file://path/to/backup-plan.json`
